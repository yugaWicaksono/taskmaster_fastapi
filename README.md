# Taskmaster API (FastAPI + mongoDB)

This is my first time building an API using FastAPI and mongoDB. Also, the first experience I have with
these both technologies. I recommend using FastAPI if you want to build an API quickly 
and has a good knowledge of python. 


## Required packages

    1. fastapi
    2. uvicorn
    3. pymongo
    4. python-dotenv
    5. pydantic
